# tropicalcyclone-forecasts
The script "tc_forecasts.py" implements the code to evaluate the performance of the subseasonal reforecasts of accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) for the GEFSv12 and ECMWF models, along with a SST-based statistical model. The reforecast skill is evaluated between July-November and over the years 2000-2019. This file is designed to be run interactively as a script. For example, after starting Python, run from your prompt:

">>>exec(open("tc_forecasts.py",'r').read())"

or from an IPython prompt:

">>>%run -i tc_forecasts.py"

The additional files in the repository provide the necessary data in order to run the script and provide the relevant performance metrics.
